# Overlook Hotel

The Overlook project is my final solo project during Mod 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. The project is an example hotel management tool for hotel staff to manage activities like customer details, booking details for different types of rooms, unbooking rooms, and calculating/showing a customerâ€™s total bill. It is designed for deepening my understanding of using OOP to drive the design of the application and the code, separating business-logic code from view-related code, and creating a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application.
