# Overlook Hotel

The Overlook project is my final solo project during Mod 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. The project is an example management system for the Overlook Hotel. It is designed for deepening my understanding of using OOP to drive the design of the application and the code, separating business-logic code from view-related code, and creating a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application.
